# Ask PDFs

Introducing "Ask PDFs": it's like having a friendly chat right within your Python application, but with a twist â€“ you can now have conversations with multiple PDF documents! Imagine being able to ask questions about these PDFs using natural language, just like you would with a friend, and getting back answers that really make sense because they're based on what's in those documents. This awesome app relies on a smart language model to whip up accurate responses to all your queries. But remember, it's worth noting that the app's chit-chat skills are solely focused on the uploaded PDFs. With "Ask PDFs" by your side, research tasks become an absolute breeze, making information discovery smoother than ever.
